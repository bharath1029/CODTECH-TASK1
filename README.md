Project Name: Simple Calculator
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a simple Python-based calculator that allows users to input two numerical values and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to perform. The program will then display the result of the chosen operation. This calculator will help demonstrate basic programming concepts such as input handling, conditional logic, and performing arithmetic operations.

Key Activities:
User Input Handling:
Prompt the user to enter two numerical values (numbers).
Ensure the input is validated to handle errors (e.g., non-numeric input).

Operation Selection:
Provide a menu for the user to select an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Allow the user to input the desired operation, ensuring it is a valid choice.

Performing the Calculation:
Based on the selected operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation between the two numbers.
Handle edge cases, such as division by zero.



Display Result:
After performing the operation, output the result of the calculation in a user-friendly format.

Error Handling:
Include error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or invalid operation choices.
Handle division by zero errors gracefully by displaying an appropriate message.

Looping and Program Termination:
Optionally, provide an option for the user to continue performing calculations or exit the program after completing a calculation.
